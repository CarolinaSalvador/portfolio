            <div class="simple-text md">
              <p>The research was based on surveys, interviews and investigation about dietary problems, behaviors and users needs. Before conducting the interviews, I listed out potential questions that may be asked during the session. These questions were centered on the following topics.</p>

                  <li><p>The lack of ideas is a big matter, they need a clear guidance where to start. Simplicity wins.</p></li>

                <p>Based on the the previous research, we can introduce Lucía. She is 32, lives in Madrid and works full time in an advertising agency as an Email Marketing Manager. She is a woman of firm beliefs who cares for her feed and has been following a veggie diet for ten years. Lucía usually cooks at home and brings her meal to work, this way ensures eating well and saves money. But it's not always like that, sometimes she finds difficult to eat healthier because overwork and the lack of time and ideas makes her have a poorly balanced diet and fall into a feed routine.</p>

              <div class="simple-text md">
                <p>The idea is to provide recipes completely adapted to the user on a mobile application because it's easier to use in the kitchen. The user needs to be at the beginning of the research process, taking decisions to avoid future frustations. These decisions will include selecting restricted ingredients and choosing dietary needs when signing up. Also, when preparing the meal, users can filter by level of difficulty of the recipe, time available for cooking and ingredients on hand, so the app can display an accurate research according to their current needs.</p>

                <p>In order to understand how a user interacts with the app to perform tasks, let's illustrate the sitemap. It was esential to keep it simple, as if the user had used it before. To achieve this goal a deep navigation was avoided, and the focus was placed on the main feature: look for recipes that match the dietary needs and preferences of the user.</p>

                <p>The next step was to create low-fidelity wireframes of the app in order to be able to test with users the sooner the better, and have feedback of the whole process done so far. The fedback received in the session was very useful to simplify the flow and to avoid distractinfg elements that weren't essential for the MVP that was being created. This process allowed me to move formard to the next step, to develop a high-fidelity prototye.</p>
